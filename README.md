### Authentication in Azure Functions (a.k.a. EasyAuth)

- Not very useful in Azure Functions alone, may work better in Web Apps or Static Web Apps, or Azure Front Door
   - The cookie will save on the Azure Functions domain and it requires 3P cookie which is deprecating
- Don't work on local Azure Functions Emulator
- Probably originated from Azure Mobile App Service (Project Zumo)
- Read this, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-customize-sign-in-out
- To authenticate:
   1. Use MSAL with scopes of "openid"
   2. Grab the `idToken`
   3. Send it to /.auth/login/aad with `{ "access_token": idToken }`
   4. Should return with `{ "authenticationToken" }`, this is a local token
   5. On every API calls, add `X-ZUMO-AUTH` with the content of `authenticationToken`
- It works on many scenarios except Server-Sent Events and Web Socket, which headers cannot be altered

### Azure Cosmos DB change feed triggering Azure Functions

- Better queue it up to Service Bus
- Otherwise, when Azure Functions fail, you have no way to retry

### JavaScript async iterator

```ts
const iterate = () => ({
  [Symbol.asyncIterator]: () => ({
    next(): IteratorResult<number> {
      // ...
    }
  }
};
```

When returning `{ done: true, value: 123 }`, the value `123` will probably gone if it's done through for-loop.

### Azure Functions: Server-Sent Events

tl;dr not supported, it just buffer up before sending the response body.

Read about [MDN Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).

Code snippet tested and the result is buffered.

```ts
app.http('...', {
  async handler() {
    const body: AsyncIterator<Uint8Array> = build(); // Will build a SSE output stream
    
    return { body, contentType: 'text/event-stream' };
  }
}
```

### Azure Durable Functions

- Orchestration through `yield` by replaying
   - Clever, `yield` is provingly good for orchestration and pause/resume, see `redux-saga`
   - Replay is mostly good, except some limitations because replay is not 100% exact
- Don't be lazy: type out activity input/output via [`valibot`](https://npmjs.com/package/valibot)

### Type template for [`valibot`](https://npmjs.com/package/valibot)

```ts
const activityInput = () => object({
  id: string(),
  name: string()
});

export default activityInput;

export const parseActivityInput = (data: unknown) => Object.freeze(parse(activityInput(), data)); // Or deep freeze

export type ActivityInput = ReadonlyDeep<Output<ReturnType<typeof activityInput>>>;
```
